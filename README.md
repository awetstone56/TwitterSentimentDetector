# TwitterSentimentDetector

## Artificial Intelligence Project

Introduction
	This project aims to allow a computer program to predict the sentiment – positive or negative – of Twitter using Machine Learning techniques. Sentiment is defined as an attitude, emotion, or feeling. As Twitter is filled with “tweets” authored by numerous individuals “tweeting” about a variety of events, the program’s job is to decide how those individuals feel. [insert process here].
  
Task Definition
  What does your system do (what is its input and output)? What real-world problem does this system try to solve?
Make sure that the scope of the project is not too narrow or broad. For example, building a system using machine learning algorithm to solve question A is too broad.

  Using Twitter’s API, we can access the most recent tweets with our program. Therefore, our input is the last 100 tweets on our home page. These tweets contain anything from [example] to [example]. As stated above, Twitter’s users tweet about a large variety of topics, so we limited our program to just pull information about one single topic using a specific hashtag. In this case, we used the hashtag #[insert thing here]. Our program then 
  
Infrastructure
  In order to do something interesting, you have to set up the infrastructure. For machine learning tasks, this involves collecting data (either by scraping, using crowdsourcing, or hand labeling). For game-based tasks, this involves building the game engine/simulator. While infrastructure is necessary, try not to spend too much time on it. You can sometimes take existing datasets or modify existing simulators to save time	
Approach	
  Identify the challenges of building the system and the phenomena in the data that you're trying to capture. How should you model the task (e.g., using search, machine learning, logic, etc.)? There will be many ways to do this, but you should pick one or two and explain how the methods address the challenges as well as any pros and cons. What algorithms are appropriate for handling the models that you came up with, and what are the tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency? Are there any implementation choices specific to your problem?
    
Literature Review
  Have there been other attempts to build such a system? Compare and contrast your approach with existing work, citing the relevant papers. The comparison should be more than just high-level descriptions. You should try to fit your work and other work into the same framework. Are the two approaches complementary, orthogonal, or contradictory?
